# doggo-photos

A photo uploading repository for users beloved dog photos. It can store any type of photo but photos of dogs are preferred.

Built using Golang, MySQL, Docker, React and some other fun JS libraries.

## Setup

Requires docker be installed locally.

### Backend

```
cd be
docker-compose up --build
```

To init the database run

```
curl  http://localhost:5000/admin/createdb  
```

This is not safe at all but allows for it to be easily reset. Definitely a very bad idea to run in production.

### Frontend
```
cd fe
npm start
```

## Use

Go to localhost:3000 in browser.

There are test images of dogs in `test-data` that can be uploaded

## Design
The app uses React on the front end to show all data and handle front end rendering. Uses a `loginKey` that is request from the backend service through authenticating with Go Server. Upon authentication the frontend will cache the `loginKey` to request all user protected data (username, photos, etc).

For image authentication the frontend must put the `loginKey` on the query string on each image owned by the user to authenticate. This `loginKey` is saved as a cookie but is delete upon logout. The `loginKey` is generated by hashing the users email and adding some random bytes onto the end. This array of bytes is then converted to a string.
